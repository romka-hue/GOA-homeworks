        <li><h3>Size </h3> <p>Eagles vary greatly in size depending on the species. The Harpy Eagle and Steller's Sea Eagle are among the largest, with wingspans of up to 2.5 meters (8.2 feet) and weights reaching 9 kg (20 lb).
        Beak and Talons: Eagles have large, hooked beaks that are designed for tearing flesh, and powerful talons to grip and kill prey. Their beaks continue to grow throughout their life.
        Eyesight: Eagles are known for their exceptional eyesight, which is 4 to 8 times stronger than a human's. They can spot prey from great distances, sometimes up to 3 km (2 miles) away.</p>
