        <h3>Physical Characteristics</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>size </h3> <p>Male lions typically weigh between 150–250 kg (330–550 lb) and can be up to 1.2 meters (4 ft) tall at the shoulder. Females are generally smaller, weighing 120–182 kg (265–400 lb).</p>
            </li>
                
            <li>
            <h3>mane</h3><p>Male lions are distinguished by their large, dark manes, which not only give them an imposing appearance but may also protect their neck during fights. The mane’s color and size are indicators of a lion’s health, fitness, and age.</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>color</h3><p>Lions have a uniform tawny coat, which helps them blend into the savanna landscape. Cubs are born with brown spots that fade with age.</p>
            </li>
